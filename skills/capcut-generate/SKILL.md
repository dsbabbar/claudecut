name: capcut-generate
description: Generate images or short videos with CapCut AI models (Seedream, GPT Image, Nano Banana Pro, Seedance) from text or reference media. Use for text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, keyframe or reference-based generation, checking or cancelling a running generation, and showing generated results.

# Generate images and videos with CapCut

Generation can spend the user's CapCut credits. **Never approve a charge on the user's behalf.**

## Choose the output

Pick by what the user wants to get, not by what they attached. An image that should move becomes a video. A poster or still frame is an image. If unclear, ask only "image or video?". Handle a request for both as two separate generations, one after the other.

## Settings

Use what the user specified and leave the rest to server defaults. If a requested value is not allowed for the model, say so and suggest the closest valid option instead of silently changing it.

### Images: `capcut_image_generate`

| Field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `model` (required) | `seedream5pro` (default choice), `gpt_image_2`, `seedream5`, `seedream4.3`, `nano_banana_pro` |
| `count` | 1 to 10, default 4 |
| `ratio` | `adaptive` (fit references), `16:9`, `3:2`, `4:3`, `5:4`, `1:1`, `4:5`, `3:4`, `2:3`, `9:16`, `21:9` |
| `resolution` | `1K`, `2K`, `4K` |
| `model_options.quality` | GPT Image 2 only: `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `reference_assets` | Up to 10 images: `{"role": "reference", "media_type": "image", "uri": <ImageX URI>}` |

### Videos: `capcut_video_generate`

| Field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `model` (required) | `seedance2` (default choice), `seedance2.5`, `seedance2_fast`, `seedance2_mini`, `seedance1_fast` |
| `count` | 1 to 4, default 1 |
| `duration_ms` | Whole seconds. `seedance1_fast`: 2000 to 12000. `seedance2.5`: 4000 to 30000. Others: 4000 to 15000. Default 5000. |
| `ratio` | `adaptive`, `21:9`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `1:1`, `3:4` |
| `resolution` | `480p`, `720p`, `1080p`, `4K` |
| `reference_assets` | Up to 50. Images use `uri` and may have role `reference`, `first_frame` or `last_frame`. Video and audio use `vid` with role `reference`. |

Every request needs a non-empty `prompt`. If the user gave none, ask for one. Do not invent the creative concept. Keep the user's wording and language. You may tidy it into a clear prompt without changing the idea.

Reference files on disk must be uploaded first with the `capcut-upload` skill. Never pass local paths or public URLs as references.

## Workflow

1. **Draft session.** Generation needs a `draft_session_id`. Reuse the one already used in this conversation. Otherwise call `start_stdraft_session` and keep its `session_id`.
2. **Optional estimate.** You may call `prepare_for_image_generation` or `prepare_for_video_generation` with the same settings to get a credit estimate and a `generate_id`. If it returns a `generate_id`, pass it to the generate call unchanged.
3. **Submit.** Call the generate tool with `draft_session_id` and `spec`. Omit `confirmed`, `unique_key` and `dont_ask_again` on the first call.
4. **Handle the response.**
   - **Queued** (free or already covered): keep the `task_id` and go to step 5.
   - **`CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`**: tell the user the exact `credits_amount` from the confirmation details and what will be generated, then **stop and wait for a clear yes**. On yes, call the same tool again with the identical `spec`, `draft_session_id`, the server-issued `unique_key` and `generate_id`, and `confirmed: true`. If the quote changes, ask again. Set `dont_ask_again: true` only if the user explicitly asks to stop being asked, and warn that it applies to all future generations on their account.
   - **Membership or credit purchase needed**: give the user the purchase or benefits link from the response and wait. After they confirm the purchase, retry with the same `generate_id`, `unique_key` and `spec`.
5. **Poll patiently.** Call `capcut_generation_poll` with the `task_id` until the task is finished and billing has settled. Between polls, wait for the delay the response suggests, or at least 10 seconds for images and 20 seconds for videos if it suggests none. Wait by running a short sleep command in the background and polling again when it completes. Never poll several times in a row without waiting. Tell the user the estimated wait once, then only report real changes.
6. **Show results.** Call `generation_result` with the `task_id`. For every result, show its full URL as a link, plus its size or duration when given. State the actual credits charged and mention any results that failed. If neither `generation_result` nor the final poll includes a URL, say so plainly. Never present a result without its link.
7. **Offer to save the files.** Ask whether to save the results to the user's computer. If yes, write the result URLs as a JSON array of `{"url": ..., "name": ...}` items (short descriptive names) to a temporary file, then run `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/download-media.mjs" --out ./capcut-output --in <items.json>`, using another folder if the user names one. Report the saved paths. For images, you can then open a saved file to check that it matches the request.

Generated results are stored in CapCut, not in an editable draft. While the `capcut-draft` skill says draft editing is not available, do not offer to place results into an edit. You may offer further generations, such as a different ratio or turning an image into a video, and always note that each costs credits after a new quote.

Never resubmit a request that already has a `task_id` or `unique_key`. Continue it instead, so the user is not charged twice.

## Cancel

Only when the user asks: call `capcut_generation_cancel` with the `task_id`, then poll once to confirm the final state and any refund.

## Errors

- Validation error: explain the invalid field and the allowed values.
- Authentication error or missing tools: follow the `capcut-connect` skill.
- Do not fall back to another image or video generator unless the user asks.
